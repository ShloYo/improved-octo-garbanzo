This is a simple file called firstbranch that I created after creating a branch called firstbranch
I used the syntax:
	git branch firstbranch
and then entered the new branch using the syntax:
	git checkout firstbranch


Then.... I went to modify the file and commit the change again in branch firstbranch

Then I made another modification.... yes, this line

Now, I merged firstbranch into the master branch and then edited the file again in master and performed the checkin
I want to compare the content of the file - looking at it from both branches (after git checkout)
